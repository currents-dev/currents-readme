# Support

### Support Channels

Currents Support team is available for issues, features requests and general inquires:

* ‚≠êÔ∏è In-app Intercom chat is the main and the preferred way to engage with Currents Support
* üìß Email support@currents.dev - this email is monitored 9/5
* üí¨ Dedicated direct Slack channel is available as part of Enterprise Plan with a direct access to team members

### Support Hours

Our formal support hours are **8am-5pm Pacific Time,** however our team members are located at various EU and US timezones, drop us a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

### Reporting Details

Whenever you're facing a technical issue, provide the following information to our support team:

* Frequency and urgency of the issue
* Testing Framework + Version
* Currents Run ID or Dashboard URL associated with the issue
* Screenshots or video recordings if applicable
* Full error message, including the stack trace, if available
* Full and relevant CI execution logs with sensitive information redacted
* CI pipeline configuration
  * The exact commands used during the execution
  * Relevant configuration of the CI setup stages

### CI Logs and Configuration

Currents offers packages that integrate with test runners in isolated CI environments, which we can‚Äôt access and don‚Äôt collect any remote telemetry from. While our backend is fully instrumented with logs and traces that allow us to investigate and pinpoint issues independently, having access to CI logs and pipeline configurations is often essential for troubleshooting.

Sharing relevant and comprehensive logs will ensure a timely, effective and successful resolution.

```
DEBUG=currents*


```

Or pass the CLI flag:
