  Setup and usage instructions for Playwright integration with Currents
  Dashboard

# @currents/playwright

### Requirements

* NodeJS 14.0.0+
* Playwright 1.22.2+

### Setup

#### Install `@currents/playwright` package

```bash
npm i -D @currents/playwright
```

#### Update `playwright.config.js|ts`

* Creating a new organization and a project at https://app.currents.dev, you'll see on-screen instructions with your newly created **Project ID** and **Record Key.**&#x20;
* Enabled traces, videos and screenshots in `playwright.config.js|ts`

```javascript
use: {
    // ...
    trace: "on",
    video: "on",
    screenshot: "on",
}
```

### Using @currents/playwright

Choose the preferred usage method for `@currents/playwright`&#x20;

* `pwc` CLI command - runs `playwright` with a predefined configuration.
* `pwc-p` CLI command - runs `playwright` with [orchestration](../../guides/parallelization-guide/pw-parallelization/playwright-orchestration.md).
* Alternatively, you can add `@currents/playwright` reporter to `playwright.config.ts`&#x20;

#### `pwc` CLI command

Run `pwc` to create your first Playwright run in Currents dashboard.&#x20;

```
npx pwc --key RECORD_KEY --project-id PROJECT_ID --ci-build-id hello-currents
```

* Set the **Record Key**, and **Project ID** obtained from Currents dashboard.
* Set `--ci-build-id` to a unique value for local testing. Learn more about [ci-build-id.md](../../guides/ci-build-id.md "mention") for CI runs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using `pwc` command overrides the reporters configured in `playwright.config.ts` - you can specify additional reporters using `--reporter` flag. Alternatively, you can explicitly add currents reported in the Playwright configuration as appears below.
{% endhint %}

#### `@currents/playwright` reporter

Alternatively, you can manually add the reporter to Playwright configuration and keep using `playwright test` CLI command.&#x20;

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices, PlaywrightTestConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import { CurrentsConfig, currentsReporter } from "@currents/playwright";

const currentsConfig: CurrentsConfig = {
  ciBuildId: "ci-build-id", // üìñ https://currents.dev/readme/guides/ci-build-id
  recordKey: "secret record key", // üìñ https://currents.dev/readme/guides/record-key
  projectId: "project id", // get one at https://app.currents.dev
};

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  reporter: [currentsReporter(currentsConfig)], // üëàüèª add Currents reporter
})
```

You can provide the required configuration as a parameter of `currentsReporter` function or as environment variables.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux" %}
```javascript
CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID \ // the projectId from https://app.currents.dev
CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY=RECORD_KEY \ // the record key from https://app.currents.dev
CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID=hello-currents \ // the CI build ID 
CURRENTS_TAG=tagA,tagB \
npx playwright test
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
```typescript
cmd /V /C "set CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID // the projectId from https://app.currents.dev
&& set CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY=RECORD_KEY // the record key from https://app.currents.dev
&& set CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID=hello-currents  // CI build id
&& set CURRENTS_TAG=tagA,tagB  // tags for the created run
&& npx playwright test"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

With the reporter configured, you can run `npx playwright test` to start sending the results to Currents dashboard. Learn more about [ci-build-id.md](../../guides/ci-build-id.md "mention").

### Configuration

#### Configuring @currents/playwright

`@currents/playwright` accepts configuration from the following sources:

* environment variables, e.g. `CURRENTS_TAG=tagA,tagB`
* CLI command options, e.g. `npx pwc ---tag tagA --tag tagB`
* reading `currentsReporter` JS configuration object, e.g. `reporters: [currentsReporter(options)]`

**Options**\
\
The following configuration options are available for both `pwc` and `pwc-p`:

* **`--ci-build-id`**&#x20;
  * the unique identifier for a run.
  * Environment variable: `CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID`
  * JS configuration key: `ciBuildId?: string`
* **`-k, --key`**&#x20;
  * your secret Record Key obtained from Currents.
  * Environment variable: `CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY`
  * JS configuration key: `recordKey: string`
* **`-p, --project-id`**&#x20;
  * the project ID for results reporting obtained from Currents.
  * Environment variable: `CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID`
  * JS configuration key: `recordKey: string`
* **`-t, --tag`**&#x20;
  * comma-separated tag(s) for recorded runs in Currents.

  * Environment variable: n/a
  * JS configuration key: `removeTitleTags?: boolean = false`
  * Released in version: `0.10.0`
* **`--pwc-disable-title-tags`**&#x20;
  * disable parsing tags from test title, e.g. `Test name @smoke` would **not** have tag  `smoke` in the dashboard (default: false). See [playwright-tags.md](../../guides/playwright-tags.md "mention").

* **`--pwc-skip-reporter-injection`**
  * Do no inject @currents/playwright reporter via CLI, use the reporter specified in the playwright config
  * Supported in CLI only
  * Released in version: `1.5.9`

#### Overriding Configuration

Certain configuration values can have multiple sources, e.g. CLI fag and environment variables. Configuration values will resolve as follows:

* first, the environment variable, if exists, otherwise
* the corresponding CLI flag if exists, otherwise
* `currentsReporter` JS configuration object, otherwise
* the default value, otherwise
* throw if the configuration is mandatory

### Examples

* Run all tests in the current directory:

```
pwc --key <record-key> --project-id <id>    
```

* Run orchestration for all tests in the current directory:

```
pwc-p --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --ci-build-id <build-id>
```

* Run only tests filtered by the tag "@smoke":

```
pwc --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --grep smoke
```

* Run playwright tests and add tags "tagA", "tagB" to the recorded run:

```
pwc --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --tag tagA --tag tagB
```

* Provide `playwright` arguments and flags:

```
pwc --key <record-key> --project-id <id> -- --workers 2 --timeout 10000 --shard 1/2
```

### Good To Know

#### Screenshots

By default, Playwright only captures screenshots at the end of a test, according to the provided [screenshot](https://playwright.dev/docs/screenshots) option. Manually created screenshots are hidden by default and won't be attached to any test.

To send screenshots to Currents, they have to be attached to the test. For example, you can attach a screenshot to a test like this

```jsx
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");

test("basic test", async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto("<https://playwright.dev>");
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
  await testInfo.attach("screenshot", {
    body: screenshot,
    contentType: "image/png",
  });
});
```

For more information see the Playwright [test info attachment](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo#test-info-attach) documentation.



### Limitations

* Rerunning with the same CI build ID would generate a warning and new results would not be uploaded. Please use a new CI build ID.
