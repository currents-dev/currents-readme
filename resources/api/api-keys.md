# API Keys

The Currents API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in [the Currents Dashboard](https://app.currents.dev).

\
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! An API key provides access to all the resources associated with an organization.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
{% endhint %}

### Managing the API Keys

Navigate to **Organization > API & Record Keys** section to manage your API keys.
