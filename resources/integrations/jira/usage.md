# Usage

Once enabled, you can create new or link an existing Jira issue directly from test execution details in Currents. You can also explore previously created or linked issues that are linked to the current test.

## Browse Linked Jira Issues

1. Open any test execution details in Currents
2. Look for the **Jira** icon (only visible when integration is enabled). If there existing (previously linked) Jira Issues related to the test, you will see a counter next to Jira icon.

By clicking on the icon you can:

* Explore linked Jira Issues
* Create a new Jira Issue
* Link an additional existing Issue

    _Note: For more specific results, use more detailed search terms._
3. Enter your comment text

### Notes

* The integration creates one-way links from Currents to Jira
* Deleting or closing Jira Issue do not remove those issues in Currents - you will need to do that manually
* Comments include a link back to the relevant test in Currents

### Limitations

#### Required Jira issue custom properties

**Problem**: Jira issues allows _required_ custom properties when an issue is created depending on the _issue type_. This is currently **not supported** in our integration, as we can't send custom payload to the create issue endpoint.

**Solution**: Two options are available to overcome this issue. First,&#x20;

* Don't enforce custom properties as required.
* Use a different issue type that has no required custom properties.
