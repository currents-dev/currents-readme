### How to access

### Integration requirements

The Currents n8n node requires a  [Currents API Key](https://docs.currents.dev/api/get-started/authentication) to be included in n8n credentials.

### What can be done?

* Build workflows that react to Currents test runs and results.
* Connect Currents to Slack, email, CRMs, databases, and other tools via n8n nodes.
* Automate notifications, reporting, and triage without writing code.

No setup is required in the Currents dashboard beyond opening the link; configure your workflows in n8n.
