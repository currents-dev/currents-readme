# Jira

Currents integration with Jira allows your team to create and link test failure details directly from the Currents dashboard. Team members can create new or add comments to existing Jira issues with full context:

* error messages,
* stack traces,
* metadata,
* and test history

without leaving Currents, eliminating context switching.
