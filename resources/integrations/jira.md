# Jira

Currents integration for Jira allows your team to create and link test failure details directly from the Currents dashboard. Team members can create new or add comments to existing Jira issues with full context:

- error messages,
- stack traces,
- metadata,
- and test history

without leaving Currents, eliminating context switching.

The integration is powered by [Currents for Jira Application](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1238333) that runs on Jira Cloud.

## Setup

1. Enable Jira Integration in project settings
2. Install [Currents for Jira](<(https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1238333)>) from Atlassian Marketplace
3. Link your accounts with installation token

See the [Setup Guide](./setup.md "mention") for complete instructions.
