# Jira

Currents integration for Jira allows your team to create and link test failure details directly from the Currents dashboard. Once installed and configured, team members can create new  (or add comments to existing) Jira issues with full context:

* error messages,
* stack traces,
* metadata,
* and test history

without leaving Currents and simplifyingtriaging the failures by eliminates context switching.



The integration is powered by [Currents for Jira Application](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1238333) that runs on Jira Cloud.
