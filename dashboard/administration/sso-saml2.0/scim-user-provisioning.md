# SCIM User Provisioning

Currents supports [SCIM v2 ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644)to automatically provision and de-provision users.

First, enable  [saml2.0-configuration.md](saml2.0-configuration.md "mention"). Once ready, contact support via in-app chat or email to request SCIM be enabled for your organization.

Once enabled by Currents support, Admins will be able to find the **SCIMv2 Endpoint** and **Authorization Bearer Token** on the **Manage Team** section at https://app.currents.dev.

### Supported features

Currents supports User resource provisioning using SCIM. **Group resources are not implemented**.

Only users with an email address that matches the domains configures in the [SSO setup](./) are supported.

When a user is deactivated, Currents removes the user from the team member list. When a user is activated, they are not added to the team member list in Currents until after they login.

The following provisioning endpoints are supported:

* GET Users&#x20;
  * List all users belonging to your organization in our system
  * Search for a specific user using SCIM filtering
* GET User
  * Get a specific user based on id
* POST User
  * Create a new user
* PUT User
  * Update an existing user's active status or display name.
* DELETE User
  * Deactivates the user

### Managed Provisioning

We are maintaining a Managed SCIM provisioning settings for popular providers:

* [Okta Provisioning](okta/okta-user-provisioning.md)
* [JumpCloud Provisioning](../../../administration/sso-saml2.0/jumpcloud/jumpcloud-user-provisioning.md)
