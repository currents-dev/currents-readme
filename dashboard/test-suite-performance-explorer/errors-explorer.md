# Errors Explorer

The Errors Explorer feature helps users identify the most frequently encountered errors that can be sorted based on various criteria, such as date, tags, author, and branch.

The feature provides a detailed breakdown of each error and its number of occurrences. Users can click on a specific error to view additional information, such as:

* **The Top Tests** ranked by the number of times the error occurred.
* **The Top Branches** where the error was encountered.
* **The Latest 10 Executions** in which the error occurred.
