# Test Suite Explorer

Test Suite Explorer allows to explore the performance and health of your testing suite by aggregating various metrics related to your tests and test files.

{% hint style="success" %}
Use [automated-reports.md](../automated-reports.md "mention") to enable a periodic report that is based in Test Suite Explorer data to proactively detect changes in test flakiness, failure rate, or duration.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In addition, an aggregated view of cross-run top errors helps identify high-impact errors that are affecting your test executions.
