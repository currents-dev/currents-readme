# Test Suite Explorer

Test Suite Explorer helps you monitor and measure the performance and reliability of your test suite. It surfaces key health metrics across individual tests and test files, including aggregated error rates and flakiness trends.

{% hint style="success" %}
Use [automated-reports.md](../automated-reports.md "mention") to enable a periodic report that is based in Test Suite Explorer data to proactively detect changes in test flakiness, failure rate, or duration.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In addition, an aggregated view of cross-run top errors helps identify high-impact errors that are affecting your test executions.
