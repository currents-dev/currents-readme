# Projects Summary view

Currents enables you to create multiple projects to better organize your test pipeline. Each project consolidates test runs and their associated metrics, identified by unique IDs that seamlessly integrate with your CI environment. Leverage features to easily visualize, configure, and archive each project.

Customize project settings within the default Projects Summary view by adjusting the lookback period and applying the following filters to suit your preferences.

* **Tags:** Filter [Tags](../../guides/playwright-tags.md) associated with the test runs in your projects.
* **Author**: Use this filter to see projects based on contributions from specific team members, which can be useful for performance reviews or tracking individual contributions.
* **Branches**: Filter projects based on the branches within your version control system.

Once youâ€™ve configured the view, save the settings to maintain your customized view for future sessions.
