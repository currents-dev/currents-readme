# Run Completion

Represents the distribution of runs by their completion over time.

## Metrics

* **Overall runs**: overall runs created during the selected period, regardless of their completion or the end state.
* **Fully reported runs**: runs that weren't cancelled and didn't time out.
* **Cancelled runs**: see [cancel-run.md](../runs/cancel-run.md "mention")
* **Timed out runs**: see [run-timeouts.md](../runs/run-timeouts.md "mention")
