# Run Status

Represents the distribution of the outcomes of your builds/runs over time.

## Metrics

* **Overall runs**: overall runs created during the selected period, regardless of their completion or the end state.
* **Failed runs**: runs that have one or more failed tests. Failed runs count includes cancelled and timed-out tests.
* **Passed runs**: runs that have zero failed tests.
* **Pass Rate**: passed runs / overall runs.
