# Currents Explorer

Currents Explorer is a Test Management analytics tool that enables users to group and examine spec files, tests, and errors according to specified criteria, thereby facilitating the identification of potential bottlenecks in test execution and streamlining the troubleshooting process.

Managing multiple spec files and tests requires a holistic view of the testing performance. By offering improved visibility and organization of test results, Currents Explorer helps users prioritize testing efforts and identify aspects that need further attention, either for Cypress or Playwright tests.

Currents divide the feature into three parts:

[**Spec Files Explorer**](spec-files-explorer/): displays a list of spec files or groups of tests executed, organized based on performance metrics.

[**Tests Explorer**](tests-explorer/): displays a list of executed tests (smallest unit of executions), organized based performance their metrics.

[**Errors Explorer**](errors-explorer.md): groups and displays the most frequently encountered errors during test execution.
