# Spec Files Performance

## Individual Spec File View

After selecting a specific spec file, users have the ability to analyze its behavior over time using six graphs that showcase key metrics. These metrics include Average Duration, Overall Duration, Suite Size, Failure Rate, Flakiness Rate, and Timeout Rate.

By analyzing these six metrics through the provided graphs, users can understand the spec file's performance, reliability, and characteristics over time. This helps to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing the quality and efficiency of testing processes.

Upon selecting a specific date from the timeline on one of the graphs, all the metrics will be displayed for that date. It allows users to examine the correlation between the metrics and any possible issues they may reveal. The Explorer also presents the execution history, where users can zoom into a specific period and analyze metrics related to test runs.

By providing these metrics and views, the Spec Files Explorer feature can help users identify patterns and trends in their execution history and make data-driven decisions to improve the reliability and efficiency of testing processes.

## Histograms

The Executions History feature exhibits histograms of spec files containing data about a specific time frame. By utilizing a brush tool, users can engage with these histograms, enabling them to zoom in and concentrate on a particular period of interest.

### Histogram Types

Within the Test Explorer, users can select from a range of histogram types, each offering visualization of different aspects of the data. A total of six options are available, providing users with a comprehensive set of metrics. These histogram types include:

1. **Overall Executions**: This histogram provides an overview of the number of executions for each spec file.
2. **Average Duration**: This histogram displays the average duration of spec file executions, allowing users to assess the performance and efficiency of their spec files.
3. **Failure Rate**: The failure rate histogram showcases the frequency of spec files that have resulted in failures, helping users identify areas that require attention and improvement.
4. **Flakiness Rate**: This histogram highlights the degree of flakiness observed in spec files, indicating the proportion of tests that exhibit inconsistent results or intermittent failures.
5. **Timeout Rate**: The timeout rate histogram presents the frequency of spec files that have experienced timeouts.
6. **Suite Size**: This histogram focuses on the size of spec files, offering insights into the distribution and composition of tests across different suites.

Users can also arrange executions based on branches using the "Collapse branch" flag. This functionality enables a more structured and organized view of the data, grouping the executions according to their respective branches.
