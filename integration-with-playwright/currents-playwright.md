  Dashboard

# @currents/playwright

### Requirements

* NodeJS 14.0.0+
* Playwright 1.22.2+

{% hint style="info" %}
The Playwright integration is in public beta mode. We have been polishing the integration, and improving the documentation and developer experience.
{% endhint %}

### Install `@currents/playwright` package

```bash
npm i -D @currents/playwright
```

### Update `playwright.config.js|ts`

* Enabled traces, videos and screenshots in `playwright.config.js|ts` to enhance the dashboard test results.
* Disable [parallelizing tests in a single file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#parallelize-tests-in-a-single-file) because it is not currently supported

```javascript
use: {
    // ...
    trace: "on",
    video: "on",
    screenshot: "on",
  }
```

Choose the preferred launch method for `@currents/playwright`&#x20;

* executing  a `pwc` CLI command - it runs `playwright` with a predefined configuration
* alternatively, you can add `@currents/playwright` reporter to Playwright configuration file

#### Using `pwc` CLI command

Run `pwc` to create your first Playwright run in Currents dashboard. Set the record key, and project id obtained from Currents dashboard in the previous step. Learn more about [CI Build ID](../guides/cypress-ci-build-id.md).

```
npx pwc --key RECORD_KEY --project-id PROJECT_ID --ci-build-id hello-currents
```

#### Configuring `@currents/playwright` reporter

Alternatively, you can manually add the reporter to Playwright configuration and keep using `playwright test` CLI command.&#x20;

```javascript
reporter: [
  // ... other reporters, if exist
  ["@currents/playwright"],
]
```

If you choose to add the reported manually, preset environment variables before running `playwright` command

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux" %}
```javascript
CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID \ // the projectId from https://app.currents.dev
CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY=RECORD_KEY \ // the record key from https://app.currents.dev
CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID=hello-currents \
npx playwright test
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
```typescript
cmd /V /C "set CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID // the projectId from https://app.currents.dev
&& set CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY=RECORD_KEY // the record key from https://app.currents.dev
&& set CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID=hello-currents 
&& npx playwright test"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

With the reporter configured, you can run `npx playwright test` to start sending the results to Currents dashboard.

### Examples

Check out the example repository for integrating with GitHub Actions: [https://github.com/currents-dev/playwright-gh-actions-demo](https://github.com/currents-dev/playwright-gh-actions-demo). Hereâ€™s a quick reference to configuration files:

* [test-basic-pwc.yml](https://github.com/currents-dev/playwright-gh-actions-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-basic-pwc.yml) - using `pwc` executable script
* [test-basic-reporter.yml](https://github.com/currents-dev/playwright-gh-actions-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-basic-reporter.yml) - using `reporter` configuration

### Good To Know

#### Screenshots

By default, Playwright only captures screenshots at the end of a test, according to the provided [screenshot](https://playwright.dev/docs/screenshots) option. Manually created screenshots are hidden by default and won't be attached to any test.

To send screenshots to Currents, they have to be attached to the test. For example, you can attach a screenshot to a test like this

```jsx
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");

test("basic test", async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto("<https://playwright.dev>");
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
  await testInfo.attach("screenshot", {
    body: screenshot,
    contentType: "image/png",
  });
});
```

For more information see the Playwright [test info attachment](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo#test-info-attach) documentation.

### Limitations

* We recommend using the native [Playwright Shards](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#shard-tests-between-multiple-machines) while we are working on other types of orchestration-related features.
* Reruns are not supported - rerunning with the same CI build ID would generate a warning and new results would not be uploaded. Please use a new CI build ID.
* Cross-machines auto-cancellation is not currently supported
* Full parallel mode ([parallelizing tests in a single file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#parallelize-tests-in-a-single-file)) is not currently supported
