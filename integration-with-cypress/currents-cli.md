**Please note**

Migrate to [cypress-cloud](cypress-cloud.md) if you are seeing any of the errors below

* `Integrity check failed`&#x20;
* `DecryptionError: JWE Recipients missing or incorrect type`
* `Cypress does not support recording test results to this third party service`
{% endhint %}

[`@current/cli`](https://github.com/currents-dev/cli) is a small npm package that allows seamless integration of cypress with Currents cloud orchestration service. The package contains an executable script that provides the same CLI and API experience as the original **cypress** package - they are 100% interchangeable.

```bash
> npm install @currents/cli cypress
> npx currents run --record --parallel --key $CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY
```

In fact, currents runs cypress command behind the scenes, passing down all the CLI flags or API options. **currents** requires **cypress** to be installed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note:** @currents/cli is designed to be used in CI environments. Using it for running cypress tests interactively is not recommended.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Using @currents/cli

Install both cypress and @currents/cli packages on your system

```bash
> npm install @currents/cli cypress
> npx currents run --record --parallel --key #currents_key
```

Use `currents` the same way you are using `cypress`- it accepts the same flags and configuration options. Usually, you end up running a somewhat similar command as part of your CI build:

```bash
npx currents run --record --parallel --ci-build-id $BUILD_ID --key $CURRENTS_KEY
```

Learn more about obtaining a [record-key.md](../guides/record-key.md "mention") and generating a [cypress-ci-build-id.md](../guides/cypress-ci-build-id.md "mention")

### API - Programmatic Usage

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note:** the documentation below is for the most recent version of the package. Please refer to the package [changelog](https://github.com/currents-dev/cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details about the previous versions.
{% endhint %}

#### `run`

Run Cypress via its [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api)

```typescript
run(config: CypressCommandLine.CypressRunOptions): Promise<CypressCommandLine.CypressRunResult | CypressCommandLine.CypressFailedRunResult>
```

Example:

```typescript
import { run } from "@currents/cli";

const cypressOptions: Partial<CypressCommandLine.CypressRunOptions> = {
  browser: "chrome",
  parallel: true,
  record: true,
  key: "Currents key from https://app.currents.dev",
  tag: "smoke",
};
const results = await run(cypressOptions);
```

#### `spawn`

Spawn Cypress as a child process and inherit all the flags and environment variables. It invokes `process.exit` with the child process' exit code at the end of its execution.

```
spawn(): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```
import { spawn } from "@currents/cli";

await spawn();
```

### Integration Details

`currents` CLI tool uses the public APIs of cypress runner. It connects the runner to Currents servers for orchestration, parallelization and reporting the results. It uses another open-source tool from the sorry-cypress project ([cy2](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/cy2)).

### Compatibility

Please refer to [compatibility.md](compatibility.md "mention").

### Deprecated Functionality

#### Additional tools within `@currents/cli` \[deprecated]

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Deprecated**: this functionality was deprecated in @currents/cli@4+
{% endhint %}

The package contains a few other utilities:

* `currents-prepare` - reconfigures cypress to use Currents dashboard without automatically launching cypress runner
* `currents-reset` - restores the original Cypress runner configuration

#### Using `currents-prepare` CLI \[deprecated]

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Deprecated**: this functionality was deprecated in @currents/cli@4+
{% endhint %}

`currents-prepare` can be useful when you need to invoke custom scripts that run `cypress` behind the scenes.&#x20;

For example: let's say you have a custom script that's starting cypress via its [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api). Before running the custom script, you'd run `currents-prepare.` It will change cypress configuration to use Currents Dashboard:

```
npm install @currents/cli cypress-repeat
npx currents-prepare
npx cypress-repeat ...
```

#### Uninstalling currents

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**: this functionality is only relevant for versions 3 and below.
{% endhint %}

Older versions of @currents/cli  (prior to 3) were used to modify cypress installation. Use one of the following methods for restoring the original cypress configuration and removing Currents from cypress package:

* Run `npx currents-reset`  from `@currents/cli` npm package to restore the original configuration
* Remove the [cached Cypress binaries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Binary-cache)
* Run `cypress install --force` to install a fresh version of cypress binaries
* Reinstall cypress npm package from scratch

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### **MacOS Ventura Users**

Running the commands in an interactive shell (or VSCode) can fail with`EPERM: operation not permitted` error.

You need to explicitly allow the shell app (or VSCode) to modify other applications.

Add the app to the App Management allowed list to stop the error.
