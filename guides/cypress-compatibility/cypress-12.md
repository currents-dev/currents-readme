# Cypress 12

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Dec 12 Update**  **üöß**

Cypress.io team has released a few breaking changes that can trigger `Integrity check failed` error when using sorry cypress or Currents.

The affected cypress versions are 12.0.2+.&#x20;

The versions listed [here](./) fix the integration but still can fail for exotic setups. As a temporary workaround, we recommend downgrading cypress version.



üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We have been working on a long-term solution, an announcement will follow soon.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:  Use the following package versions that are compatible with Cypress 12.0.0-12.0.2**

* &#x20;`@currents/cli`  version 3.1.3 or later
* `cy2` users, please use version 3.4.1 or later
* `@currents/nx` users, please use version 0.2.1 or later

### Cypress 12 Changes

Version [12.0.0](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/12/06/announcing-cypress-12/) of Cypress runner was released on Dec 06, 2022. The new release introduced a new packaging method for their package.

Starting from version 12.0.0 cypress is installed with a pre-compiled serialized v8 bytecode file. As [claimed](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24909), using the bytecode file should improve startup and unzip time.&#x20;

The pre-compiled binary file also has a series of embedded integrity checks. The checks would throw an exception after detecting a change in the package.&#x20;

This directly affects Currents and Sorry Cypress integration with cypress runner. Both slightly modify the contents of the package, changing the API endpoints URL - so every developer or company can use their own cloud service.

### Cypress 12 and Currents/Sorry Cypress

The new architecture introduced a breaking change. Please refer to the [reference table](./) to find a compatible version  of `@currents/cli,` `cy2` and `@currents/nx` .

We have been monitoring new cypress releases and working on a long-term solution that is not prone to Integrity check errors.
