# Orchestration Setup

Orchestration helps decrease the duration of Playwright tests in CI pipelines. Read our detailed guide on [playwright-parallelization.md](playwright-parallelization.md "mention") that compares the native sharding with orchestration.



### How does it work

`@currents/playwright` contains a command-line executable `pwc-p` ‚Äî  a lightweight wrapper that implements  Orchestration and runs Playwright behind the scenes.

* it scans the testing suite
* it establishes an orchestration session with Currents servers
* **it** runs Playwright, executing spec files in the optimal order
* the results are recorded to Currents for troubleshooting and analysis



### Setup

Install `@currents/playwright`

```bash
npm i @currents/playwright
```

\


Replace `playwright` command with `pwc-p`&#x20;

```bash
npx pwc-p --key <record-key> --project-id <project-id> --ci-build-id <ci-build-id>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Read more about [ci-build-id.md](../ci-build-id.md "mention")  and [reporting-strategy.md](../parallelization-guide/reporting-strategy.md "mention")&#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

`pwc-p` accepts additional playwright arguments and flags (see [currents-playwright](../../resources/reporters/currents-playwright/ "mention")), for example:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Add additional playwright arguments and flags:
pwc-p --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --ci-build-id <build-id> -- --workers 2 --timeout 10000
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
There's no need to define shards,

Make sure to remove `--shard` flag ‚Äî Currents uses all the available machines automatically.
{% endhint %}



A successfully created orchestration prints an output similar to this:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
$ npx pwc-p --key **redacted** --project-id **redacted** --ci-build-id `date +%s`  -c ./or8n/playwright.config.ts

{% endcode %}

### Orchestration and Reporters

#### Adding Additional Reporters

`pwc-p` automatically injects Currents reporter [currents-playwright](../../resources/reporters/currents-playwright/ "mention") into playwright, replacing all other reporters configured in `playwright.config.ts` . To add additional reporters use one of the two options



**Add additional reporters via a CLI parameter.**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# passing additional reporters:
pwc-p --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --ci-build-id <build-id> --reporter="./myreporter/my-awesome-reporter.ts"
```
{% endcode %}



**Prevent automatic injection of Currents reporter, add it manually.**

* Create `currents.config.ts` with the following contents:

```typescript
import { CurrentsConfig } from "@currents/playwright";

const config: CurrentsConfig = {
  recordKey: process.env.CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY,
  projectId: process.env.CURRENTS_PROJECT_ID,
  ciBuildId: "value", // ‚ö†Ô∏è Set the value as described in CI build ID guide
  orchestration: {
    skipReporterInjection: true, // prevent automatic reporter injection
  },
};

export default config;
```

* Update `playwright.config.ts`

```typescript
import { currentsReporter } from "@currents/playwright";
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from "@playwright/test";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    currentsReporter(), // Currents reporter will use 
    // reporter
  ],

  // ... rest of playwright configuration
}
```

* **Optional:** Update `pwc-p` CLI  command

`pwc-p` reads all the configuration from `currents.config.ts` - no need to use CLI params.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
pwc-p  -- [...playwright-cli-params]
```
{% endcode %}



#### Merging Fragmented Reports

Orchestration dynamically pulls test files from a central server, and each pull starts a fresh Playwright process. This can impact reporters that write output files‚Äîsince a new process runs for each pull, you may need to handle file overwrites and merge results correctly.

The solution is to use the `blob` reporter to gather all the fragmented results and merge them.

```bash
# The PWTEST_BLOB_DO_NOT_REMOVE env variable is needed 
# to preserve the `blob-report` directory between orchestrated spec runs
PWTEST_BLOB_DO_NOT_REMOVE=1 pwc-p --key <record-key> --project-id <id> --ci-build-id <build-id> --reporter blob
```

You can generate other reports by passing the blob results to the `merge-reports` command.

```bash
npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=html ./blob-report
```

### Orchestration and Multiple Workers

`@currents/playwright#13.0.0+` supports automatic detection of global workers and the orchestration adjusts to make the best use of the available workers.&#x20;

When multiple workers are enabled, the orchestrator creates a  "batch" of multiple test files to ensure the most optimal utilization of all the available workers. The batch runs as single playwright command.

As of May 2025, the Playwright Test Runner [does not respect the execution order of test files](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/35743). This means that even if Currents suggests an optimal execution order, Playwright may run files in a different sequence when multiple workers are used. It only affects cases when multiple workers are involved and has a minor impact.

Also see [fully-parallel-mode.md](fully-parallel-mode.md "mention").

#### Batch size configuration

The batch size can be configured via [env variable or cli option](https://docs.currents.dev/resources/reporters/currents-playwright/pwc-p-orchestration#pwc-batch-size-less-than-auto-or-number-greater-than).

&#x20;Starting at `@currents/playwright` version `1.14.0`  and `@playwright/test` version starting at `1.52.0` the option can be set per project.

This means that the batch size can be handled globally, that also supports automatic detection of global workers, but also the project level workers and batch size is taken into account for defining the batch size.

Batch size for each project is determined by evaluating options in the following order of priority:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Global batch size

A global batch size defined via [environment variable or CLI option](https://docs.currents.dev/resources/reporters/currents-playwright/pwc-p-orchestration#pwc-batch-size-less-than-auto-or-number-greater-than) will override any batch size or worker settings defined at the project level.

<sub>Starting with version</sub> <sub></sub><sub>`1.13.0`</sub><sub>, the reporter can automatically detect and use the global worker count as the batch size, if global workers are defined.</sub>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project batch size

`currentsBatchSize` defined at [project level](playwright-orchestration.md#project-level-batch-size)

<sub>This configuration is available in</sub><sub>`@currents/playwright`</sub> <sub></sub><sub>version starting at</sub>  <sub></sub><sub>`1.14.0`</sub>  <sub></sub><sub>and</sub> <sub></sub><sub>`@playwright/test`</sub> <sub></sub><sub>version starting at</sub> <sub></sub><sub>`1.52.0`</sub>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project workers

`workers` defined at [project level](playwright-orchestration.md#project-level-workers)

<sub>This configuration is available in</sub><sub>`@currents/playwright`</sub> <sub></sub><sub>version starting at</sub>  <sub></sub><sub>`1.14.0`</sub>  <sub></sub><sub>and</sub> <sub></sub><sub>`@playwright/test`</sub> <sub></sub><sub>version starting at</sub> <sub></sub><sub>`1.52.0`</sub>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Global workers

[Globally defined `workers`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-workers)&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Default

If none of the above is defined, batch size is `1`
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Project level workers

This feature allows you to set the number of workers at project level, enabling each project to specify its own batch size based on the workers.

This is how the workers can be defined:

```typescript
...
projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
      workers: 2
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] },
      workers: 3
    },
  ],
...
```

Currents will use the batch size **`auto`** option by default. This means the reporter will read each project workers setting and use it as batch size.

If no workers are defined for a project, Currents will use the global workers value as batch size.

#### Project level batch size

The Playwright project configuration can be extended with `currentsBatchSize` which explicitly sets the batch size per project. Import `CurrentsFixtures` for typescript suport.\


```typescript
import type { CurrentsFixtures } from "@currents/playwright";
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig<CurrentsFixtures>({
  ...
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { 
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"], 
        currentsBatchSize: 3 
      },
      workers: 2,
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { 
        ...devices["Desktop Firefox"], 
        currentsBatchSize: "auto"
      },
    },
  ],
  ...
});

```

In this example, the `chromium` project has 2 workers defined. However, since the `currentsBatchSize` property is set, Currents will use the specified `currentsBatchSize` instead of the workers value.

For the `firefox` project, the `currentsBatchSize` is set to `auto`, so Currents will use the project‚Äôs workers value. Since it is not defined, Currents will fall back to the global workers value.

### Re-running Only Failed Tests

Re-running only failed tests for orchestrated runs requires collecting the results from multiple machines, or alternatively getting the failed test from Currents [api](../../resources/api/ "mention"). We have created a set of tools to simplify the setup. See [re-run-only-failed-tests.md](re-run-only-failed-tests.md "mention").



### Limitations and Nuances

* Orchestration works on a **file level** - i.e. it balances test files (rather than tests)
* [**Playwright Project dependencies**](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects#dependencies) is not supported - i.e. if you have projects that depend one on another, orchestration will not consider the dependencies. As a workaround, run the dependencies in the desired order explicitly by defining separate CI steps with `--project <name>` [specification.](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects#run-projects)&#x20;
* [**Global Setup and Teardown**](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown). An orchestrated execution will run `playwright` command multiple times. Beware, that the global setup or teardown routines will run for each invocation of `playwright`.
