# CI Tests on Spot Instances



{% hint style="info" %}
* Get familiar with [playwright-orchestration.md](playwright-orchestration.md "mention")
* Requires `@currents/playwright@1.3.0+`
{% endhint %}

### Cost Efficiency of Spot Instances

Many cloud providers have an option to use [Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) for running workloads. Using Spot Instances can cost up to 90% lower, compared to the traditionally allocated resources.

However, spot instances can be terminated at any time, which can cause the loss of the test results.&#x20;

Currents Orchestration can automatically reassign the tests from to-be-terminated instance to another machine. This way, the execution can continue without manual intervention.

### How it works

Imagine a scenario when you have two machines running a testing suite consisting of two spec files.&#x20;

* Machine A - running specA
* Machine B - running specB

When a spot instance is just about to be terminated (let's say Machine A),  Currents will identify the affected spec files and reassign them a different machine.&#x20;

### Setup and&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only tests orchestrated with `pwc-p` can be dynamically reassigned. Read more about [playwright-orchestration.md](playwright-orchestration.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

Starting from version `1.3.0` of `@currents/playwright,` you can specify a `pwc-p` option:

```
pwc-p .... --pwc-reset-signal SIGUSR1|SIGUSR2
```

When specified, `pwc-p` will start listening to POSIX signal (`SIGUSR1` or `SIGUSR2`). After receiving the signal, the tool will send a request to Currents servers with the details of the tests that need to be reassigned.&#x20;

Currents will update the run status accordingly and will send the affected tests to the first available CI machine.

An example output you're expected to see upon termination:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
$ npx pwc-p --key XXX --project-id YYY --ci-build-id reset-001 --pwc-reset-signal SIGUSR1

Refer to the following documentation for capturing the eviction notice for various cloud providers:

* [AWS - Spot Instance interruption notice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-instance-termination-notices.html)
* [Azure - Simulate Spot Virtual Machine eviction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/virtual-machines/windows/spot-powershell#simulate-an-eviction)
* [GCP - Spot VM preemption process](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot#preemption-process)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is your responsibility to capture the eviction notice, detect the PID and send the signal to the`pwc-p` process before an eviction.&#x20;

* `usr1` normally activates the node debugger, but this ability is disabled when we listen on usr1
* `usr2` normally treated as a exit in node, so if you pass it WITHOUT turning on our listener, you will immediately kill the process
* You must signal the `pwc-p` node process, and **not the npx or wrapper process**. The parent process will just behave as noted above and not pass the signal down to our process.
