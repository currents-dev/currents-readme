# Introduction

The Currents API allows programmatic access to the data created during the execution of your cypress test.

The base URL for accessing the API is

```
https://api.currents.dev
```

The API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_State\_Transfer). Our API has resource-oriented URLs, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
