* Your existing users should have been auto-matched based on email. If there are any additional Currents users that failed to be matched, you can import them from the import screen. (See [JumpCloud's Importing Users Guide](https://jumpcloud.com/support/provision-and-manage-users-and-groups-in-apps-using-custom-scim-identity-management-integration#importing-users))

## Known Issues/Troubleshooting

#### Unsupported Features

The Currents User Provisioning does not support the following JumpCloud Identity Management features:

* Group Management
* Sync password

#### Limited profile attributes updates

Currents does not accept updates to the following attributes:

* **userType** - changing a user's role is only supported from the Currents team member dashboard
* **userName** - the mapped userName must match the primary email
* **email** - the primary email cannot be changed

#### Username errors on import

JumpCloud attempts to use the first part of the email as the username when importing new users from Currents.  (eg, `andrew@currents.dev` becomes `andrew` )

If your users have a `+` character in their email, the import will fail. To workaround, first create the user in JumpCloud, then sync them with Currents. JumpCloud and Currents will sync based on the user email.

#### User Activation Error

When setting up Identify Management in JumpCloud, you must use a new user as the test email, otherwise you get errors during the test.
