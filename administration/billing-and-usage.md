# Billing & Usage

The Billing and Usage view is accessible by accessing the org management menu - click on **Organization > Billing & Usage.** Within the Billing & Usage view, you can explore the organization's usage and plan limits, and manage the subscription and billing email recipients.

### Billing Emails

You can add recipients for billing-related notifications:

* notification about successful payments
* alerts about non-successful payments
* invoices and receipts

Please note, that billing notifications are different from operations notifications (by default operations notifications are being sent to all the members with Admin rol)

In order to add additional recipients, navigate to **Organization > Billing & Usage.** Then add a new email in the **Billing Emails** section:
