You can integrate Currents with any CI provider. Currents collects test results from multiple parallel CI machines for more effective debugging and investigation. Currents stores all test-related artifacts in cloud:

* Screenshots
* Videos
* Console logs
* Playwright Traces

Combined with test reports, Currents detects flakiness and provides contextual information like test execution history, duration, and top errors. This helps your team to efficiency fix CI failures and flaky tests.
