With Currents, you can run your tests in parallel on the CI provider of your choice - Currents will collect the results, distributed between multiple parallel machines, for further investigation and collecting analytics. Currents unlocks running and orchestrating parallel Cypress tests and also is compatible with Playwright native sharding.

With convenient access to troubleshooting tools:

* screenshots
* videos
* console logs
* Playwright Traces

combined with flakiness detection and contextual information like test results history, duration, failure, flakiness and top errors, your team gets better control and resolves CI failures and flakiness more efficiently.

Currents helps software teams to manage their test suite beyond a single failure - we collect and aggregate test results, providing actionable, fine-tuned insights and periodic reports that QA and software team leads and directors use to drive organization-wise testing-related goals.
