Currents is a cloud reporting service compatible with Playwright and Cypress. It helps QA and software teams with debugging, troubleshooting, and analyzing their parallel CI tests.

With Currents, you can run your tests in parallel on the CI provider of your choice. Currents will collect the test results, distributed between multiple parallel machines, for further investigation and collecting analytics. Currents unlocks running and orchestrating parallel Cypress tests and also is compatible with Playwright native sharding.

Currents provides convenient access to troubleshooting tools and artifacts, such as:

* Screenshots
* Videos
* Console logs
* Playwright Traces

combined with test reports that detect flakiness and provide contextual information like test execution history, duration, and top errors. This helps your engineering team better manage and fix CI failures and flaky tests with more efficiency.
